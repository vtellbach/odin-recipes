    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>100g Semolina Flour</li>
            <li>100g All-Purpose Flour</li>

        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, mix both flours. Pour onto a clean surface and form a well in the center, enough to hold 2 eggs.</li>
            <li>Crack both eggs into the well and use a fork to gently beat the eggs.</li>
            <li>With the fork, gently pull in flour from the sides and mix with the eggs. Continue until too think to use the fork.</li>
            <li>Use your hands to knead in the rest of the flour and knead thoroughly for 10 min. The dough should be firm but smooth and spring back if you press in with a finger.</li>
            <li>Wrap the dough in plastic and let rest in fridge for 60 min.</li>
            <li>Now your fresh pasta dough is ready to use!!</li>
            <li>Form into your desired shape (roll/make a bit thinner than normal since they will get thicker when cooked) and boil in salted water for 2-5 min (depending on the thickness).</li>
            <li>Toss with sauce and serve!</li>
        </ol>
